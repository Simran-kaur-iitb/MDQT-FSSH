# Azzouz-Borgis
Fortran Code of SHS paper (Proton transfer in Solution)
#
#Run the code using:
#gfortran md.f90 
#./a.out
#upon running the code various output files will be generated. The format of the output files will be fort.Number. The details of what is stored in each file can be
#looked at in the code.

#For AJ.f90 (Code for 2D Hamiltonian simulating potential akin to Azzouz Borgis Model)
#LAPACK AND BLAS package will be needed to be downloaded 
#To run the AJ.f90 use the command:
#ifort AJ.f90 -mkl
#an additional flag -O2 may be added for added speed.
